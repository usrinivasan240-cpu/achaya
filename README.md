# E‑Library (HTML/CSS/JS)

A lightweight, client‑side demo E‑Library web app built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No build tools or frameworks required.

Features
- Browse a curated set of sample books
- Search by title, author, or description
- Filter by genre and availability
- Sort by title, author, year, or rating
- Mark favorites and borrow/return books
- "My Books" view to quickly access Favorites or Borrowed
- State persists locally via localStorage

Getting started
1. Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser.
2. That’s it! Changes to your favorites/borrowed lists are stored locally.

Project structure
- `index.html` — App shell and layout
- `styles.css` — Styling and responsive layout
- `script.js` — App logic, rendering, and persistence

Notes
- Book covers are placeholder images from picsum.photos seeded by book id.
- This project intentionally avoids build steps for simplicity.
